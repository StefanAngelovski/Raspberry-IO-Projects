This project is a collection of **pre-tested sample codes** designed to help users troubleshoot software-related issues with various components on the Raspberry Pi. It serves as a **repository of working code**, making it easier to debug, test, and integrate hardware components.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a **quick and reliable** way to verify if a component is functioning correctly or if a software issue is causing errors. By offering **tested examples**, it saves time and effort when working on embedded projects with the Raspberry Pi.

## Features

- **Pre-tested sample code** for various Raspberry Pi-compatible components.
- Helps diagnose software issues and confirm component functionality.
- Covers common sensors, modules, and peripherals.
- A useful repository for quick prototyping and debugging.

## Usage

1. Browse through the provided **code samples** in the repository.
2. Locate the relevant component or peripheral you're working with.
3. Run the sample code on your Raspberry Pi setup.
4. Use the results to determine if the component is functioning correctly or if further debugging is needed.

This repository is a valuable resource for embedded development, ensuring **faster debugging** and a smoother development experience. Feel free to contribute by adding new sample codes or improving existing ones!
